## Incorrect Interface Vulnerability
For this example we will use <strong> Alice.sol </strong> and <strong> Bob.sol </strong>. <br>
After copying and compiling them on Remix, we can audit the code to see how it works. <br>
### Alice.sol
Alice.sol contract has two functions, set , and set_fixed that both get an int argument. 
There is also a so-called fallback function that sets the val to 1.
### Bob.sol
Bob.sol calls Alice.sol internally by using an Interface of its methods. Though set_fixed is correct, 
set is not as it uses a uint argument instead of an int. Thus, if we call set using the Alice contract's address 
from Bob.sol the fallback function is called and not set, because the interface is not correct.

### Reproducing the vulnerability
``` 
Compile and Deploy Both contracts

```
Click on val and check out that its initial value is 0.
```

```
Let's use set_fixed from Bob. It should set the val to 42. (use Alice's address as argument)
```

```
The transaction has been added to the chain.

```
The val now is 42.
```

<strong> REPRODUCING THE INCORRECT INTERFACE VULNERABILITY </strong> <br>
Now, let's do the same, calling set instead of set_fixed. If not for the incorrect interface, the val should stay at 42. <br>
Instead, because of the incorrect interface, Alice's fallback function has been used, thus val is now 1.
```
After the transaction has been added to the chain, calling val from Alice shows that val is 1.
