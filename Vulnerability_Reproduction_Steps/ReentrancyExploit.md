## Reentrancy vulnerability and exploitation

We need two or more Ropsten accounts for this example. <br>

1) Load, Compile and Deploy <strong> Reentrancy.sol </strong> and <strong> ReentrancyExploit.sol </strong> <br>

### Idea of Reentrancy exploit 

Basically, the Reentrancy contract plays the role of a fund where nodes can deposit eth and can also withdraw them. <br>
When a node calls the withdrawBalance() function, the Reentrancy contract attempts to give userBalance ethers to the user account, but calls the fallback function if the user is a contract.
<br>So, we can create an exploit contract calling withdraw, and calling withdraw again in the fallback function, withdrawing the double amount.
```
e.g. Using the ReentrancyExploit.sol
Let's say that there are already 2 eth in the balance of the Reentrancy.sol fund.
Deposit 2 eth using the ReentrancyExploit function deposit and the address of the Reentrancy contract.
Call launch_attack function of the exploit.
When the transaction has been made, call get_money suicide function and see that 4 eth have been returned instead of 2
```
